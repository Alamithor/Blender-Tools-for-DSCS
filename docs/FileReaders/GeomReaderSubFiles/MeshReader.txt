These files are split into five main sections:
        1. The header, which gives file pointers to split the file into its major sections, plus counts of what appears
           in each section.
        2. A section that contains raw byte data for each vertex.
        3. A section that contains bone indices which have vertices assigned to them by this mesh.
        4. A section that defines the polygons.
        5. A section that states how to construct meaningful information out of the raw vertex bytes.

There are eight unknown bytes still in the header:
    - 0x31 - 0x32: a uint16 that takes the values 1, 4, 5. Appears to describe which vertex components are 
                   avaiable; 4 corresponds to only Position and Normal, but the distinction between 1 and 5 
                   is unclear.
    - 0x34 - 0x37: Highly variable with no obvious data type, might refer to something in an external table.
    - 0x4C - 0x50: Appears to be a float. Correlated with the bounding box lengths, always smaller than the
                   norm of the lengths interpreted as a vector.

In addition, max_vertex_groups_per_vertex needs verifying; and mesh_centre and bounding_box_lengths are only 
sometimes correct for unknown reasons.

The section on vertices contains a number of bytes per vertex as defined in the header. What this data means is described
by the fourth and final section.

The second section lists all the vertex groups of the mesh, by listing bone indices.

The third section contains a string of vertex indices that describes the polygons.

The final section describes how to interpret the vertex data.
There are 10 different types of data that can be attached to vertices:
    - Position
    - Normal vector
    - Unknown 1
    - Unknown 2
    - UV coordinates
    - Unknown 3
    - Unknown 4
    - Unknown 5
    - Vertex group
    - Vertex weight

The position sometimes contains 3 floats, and sometimes contains 4. The purpose of the fourth is totally unclear.
Unknown 3 appears to be used for defining the UVs of animated textures: unverified.
Unknown 5 appears to be vertex colours: unverified.

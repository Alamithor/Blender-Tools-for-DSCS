The BoneDataReader is small and reads 12 floats.

These are arranged in groups of 4 like (3D unit vector, float)
The 3D unit vectors are orthogonal within precision errors, and appear to define a local xyz axis,
although this needs to be checked. The first unit vector is generally in the purposed pure 'x' direction,
the second in the 'y' direction, and the third in the 'z' direction. It needs to be verified if this is the case,
and what it is used for - perhaps bone rotation.

The scalars attached to each unit vector appear to give the x, y, and z positions of each bone respectively.

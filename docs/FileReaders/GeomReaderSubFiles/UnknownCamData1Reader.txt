The CamData1 mostly exists in Cam files and environments. It is made of 0x40 bytes.

The data types are unclear and are mostly guesses.
There are clear correlations between CamData1 and CamData2; both contain sections that
look like int16 - half-float pairs.

The purpose of the data is completely unclear.

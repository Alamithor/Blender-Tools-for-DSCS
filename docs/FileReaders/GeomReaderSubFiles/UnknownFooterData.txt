5237 / 8448 files contain a 1052-byte chunk of data at the end of the file.

The first byte carries a number 0-31.
The next three bytes are padding bytes, or part of the data type of the first byte.
The next 12 bytes carry some data.

Then, every byte value 0x00 -> 0xff is printed in quaduplets.
The fourth of these quadruplets is not always the same value as the previous three;
it could take any of three values >= the "value" of the quadruplet.

The final 12 bytes carry some non-zero value.

The meaning of this data is totally unknown.

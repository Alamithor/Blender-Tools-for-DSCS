These files are split into eight main sections:
        1. The header, which gives file pointers to split the file into its major sections, plus counts of what appears
           in each section.
        2. Pairs of bone indices that seem to have something to do with parent-child relationships, 8 int16s per element
        3. A section of 12 floats per bone
        4. A section of 1 int16 per bone that gives the parent of each bone
        5. A section of one-multiple-of-8 per unknown_0x0C
        6. A section of 4 bytes per bone
        7. A section of 1 (u?)int32 per unknown_0x0C
        8. A section of 4 bytes per unknown_0x0C

There are two counts in the file:
	1. num_bones: The number of bones
	2. unknown_0x0C: An unknown count that several data sections depend upon.
	3. num_unknown_parent_child_data: A count that describes how many chunks are in the first data section

The first section appears to mostly contain parent-child data. 
However, the data comes in chunks of 8 int16s, which lumps four parent-child-pairs together.
Moreover, some of the 'parents' are unusually large numbers, and some relationships are repeated.
The purpose of this data is unknown, since the pairs appear to be fully covered by section 3.

The second section contains 12 floats per bone. The first four appear to be a rotation quaternion,
the next three appear to be a position (which does not always agree with the positions in the .geom files)
followed by a 1, the next three may be a scale (usually three 1s) followed by another 1.

The third section is one int16 per bone, which lists the parent bone for the bone at the index it is listed.

The fourth section is a string of 0x00, 0x08, and 0x10 (mostly 0x08); one per unknown_0x0C.

The fifth section is a section of 4 bytes per bone. These bytes do not seem to give consistent results for any data type.
They may be a hex referring to a particular effect, although verifying this does not seem easy.

The sixth section is a section of 4 bytes per unknown_0x0C that look like unint32s.
They are usually consecutive for unknown_0x0C = 2, e.g. 1304, 1305.

The final section contains 4 more bytes per unknown_0x0C that have unknown typing.

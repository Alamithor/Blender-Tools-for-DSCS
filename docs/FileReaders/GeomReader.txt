These files are split into eight main sections:
        1. The header, which gives file pointers to split the file into its major sections, plus counts of what appears
           in each section.
        2. A section that describes the geometry of each mesh.
        3. A section that describes each defined material.
        4. A section of file names for texture images.
        5. A section of unknown data that appears in CAM-type files, amongst others.
        6. Another section of unknown data that appears in CAM-type files, amongst others.
        7. A section of bone data which includes bone positions.
        8. A section of unknown data that appears to be largely filler.

The first section is handled by the MeshReader class.
The second section is handled by the MaterialReader class.
The third section is a series of 32-byte null-terminated strings of texture filenames.
The fourth section is handled by the UnknownCamData1Reader class.
The fifth section is handled by the UnknownCamData2Reader class.
The sixth section is handled by the BoneReader class.
The seventh section is confusing and documented in UnknownFooterData.

The header appears to be fully decoded; however it is possible that for some file the
geom_centre and geom_bounding_box_lengths are not accurate or indeed all 0s.
This needs to be signed off, and if necessary, fixed before the class is marked complete.

Incomplete sections:
